  title: "Mobile Game Developer"
  bio: "Howard Go is ½ of MochiBits, a game development team born on December 2010. He believes the mobile market allows the casual gamer/user to exist which in turn changes the playing field sufficiently to allow more indie developers to play with the big boys (although in smaller, yet thriving niches). He wants to see more Filipinos populate and succeed in the world of mobile app development (before the big boys make it harder)."
